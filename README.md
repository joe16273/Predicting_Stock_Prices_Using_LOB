# Predicting_Stock_Prices_Using_LOB
We set out to find a way to predict the price of a stock, and to do this we aimed to use market
microstructure data. We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-LSTM model to analyze
market microstructure data in order to predict the price of a stock. Modern stock market order
books log every transaction, producing a wealth of data that can be analyzed. While most stock
market analyses focus on the actual price of a stock, this price is not always the true
representation of the stock's value. Market microstructure data, including the level 2 and level 3
orderbook data that shows individual bids and asks on the book, can provide a more detailed
understanding of a stock's true value. By analyzing this data at such a small scale, we aimed to improve the predictive power of our model.
